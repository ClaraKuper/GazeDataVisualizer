library to explore gaze visualizations 

written 2022 by Clara Kuper for Pupil Labs

challenge: aggregated gaze data can be hard to interpret - mean values don't take into account information about missing data, and uncertainty/error measures are difficult to interpret for unexperienced spectators.
ideal solution: a data visualization pipeline that communicates uncertainty and missing data points intuitivly

suggested approaches:
- exploring different ways to visualize error and uncertainty 
- interactive plots with attached metadata
